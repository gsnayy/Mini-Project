# Mini-Project
1) Please create a C++ program that ask the user for 4 separate values as follows: 
a. String for a sports team (team name and sport)
i. i.e. Michigan Wolverines - Football
b. Double for head Coach salary
c. Double for expenses for the team
d. Double for annual revenue of sport
e. String for head coach first and last name (must be private)
 

The program will use a class called sports with the methods:

​​* print

​​* getTeam (team name and sport)

​​* getCoachName (first and last)

​​* getCoachSalary

​​* getExpenses

​​* getRevenue

​The program will calculate the gross profit of the sport. 

The program must be done within implementation file, header file, and the main() program. The header file will include the class prototypes, the implementation file will include the actual function details and the main() program will contain the calling of the function(s)
